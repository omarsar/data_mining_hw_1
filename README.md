### Instructions
Please carefully review the following instructions to complete Assignment 1. These instructions assume that you have already created your Github account and you came to the first lab session.  
1. Since all assignments must be submitted, individually by each student, to their Github account, you first must `Fork` this repository so that we are able to check your individual submissions through Github. If you don't use the `Fork` feature we will not be able to locate your assignment repository.

2. Once you have forked this repository, you can find additional instructions for your assignment in the `hw_1.ipynb` jupyter notebook. Try to follow each instruction carefully so as to avoid any deductions. 

3. Once you have finished all the tasks in the given notebook, and you are ready to make final submission, you should change the name of your notebook (`hw_1.ipynb`) to this format (`StudentName_StudentID.ipynb`), and then publish changes to your Github forked repository. You can make as much changes to your repository as necessary, since we will check assignments until due date. After due date, you are not allowed to make any more changes to your respositories. (Please carefully follow these instructions)
